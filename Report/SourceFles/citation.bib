abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing number of studies applying image processing techniques to analyze melanocytic lesions for atypia and possible malignancy and for total-body mole mapping. However, such lesions can be partially obscured by body hairs. None of these studies has fully addressed the problem of human hairs occluding the imaged lesions. In our previous study we designed an automatic segmentation program to differentiate skin lesions from the normal healthy skin, and learned that the program performed well with most of the images, the exception being those with hairs, especially dark thick hairs, covering part of the lesions. These thick dark hairs confused the program, resulting in unsatisfactory segmentation results. In this paper, we present a method to remove hairs from an image using a pre-processing program we have called DullRazor®. This pre-processing step enables the segmentation program to achieve satisfactory results. DullRazor® can be downloaded as shareware from http://www.derm.ubc.ca.}

                   via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train
                   two models: a generative model G that captures the data
                   distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates
                   the probability that a sample came from the training data
                   rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize
                   the probability of D making a mistake. This framework
                   corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of
                   arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with
                   G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to
                   1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by
                   multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained
                   with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains

                   training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate

                   its characteristic artifacts, and propose changes in both

                   particular, we redesign the generator normalization, revisit

                   encourage good conditioning in the mapping from latent codes

  abstract  = "Skin cancer is common nowadays. Early diagnosis of skin cancer
               is essential to increase patients' survival rate. In addition to
               traditional methods, computer-aided diagnosis is used in
               diagnosis of skin cancer. One of the benefits of this method is
               that it eliminates human error in cancer diagnosis. Skin images
               may contain noise such as like hair, ink spots, rulers, etc., in
               addition to the lesion. For this reason, noise removal is
               required. The noise reduction in lesion images can be referred
               to as noise removal. This phase is very important for the
               correct segmentation of the lesions. One of the most critical
               problems in using such automated methods is the inaccuracy in
               cancer diagnosis because noise removal and segmentation cannot
               be performed effectively. We have created a noise dataset (hair,
               rulers, ink spots, etc.) that includes 2500 images and masks.
               There is no such noise dataset in the literature. We used this
               dataset for noise removal in skin cancer images. Two datasets
               from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) and the
               PH2 were used in this study. In this study, a new approach
               called LinkNet-B7 for noise removal and segmentation of skin
               cancer images is presented. LinkNet-B7 is a LinkNet-based
               approach that uses EfficientNetB7 as the encoder. We used images
               with 16 slices. This way, we lose fewer pixel values. LinkNet-B7
               has a 6\% higher success rate than LinkNet with the same dataset
               and parameters. Training accuracy for noise removal and lesion
               segmentation was calculated to be 95.72\% and 97.80\%,

    abstract = {Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadly types of cancer. Dermatologists diagnose this disease primarily visually. Multiclass skin cancer classification is challenging due to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of its various diagnostic categories. On the other hand, recent studies have demonstrated that convolutional neural networks outperform dermatologists in multiclass skin cancer classification. We developed a preprocessing image pipeline for this work. We removed hairs from the images, augmented the dataset, and resized the imageries to meet the requirements of each model. By performing transfer learning on pre-trained ImageNet weights and fine-tuning the Convolutional Neural Networks, we trained the EfficientNets B0-B7 on the HAM10000 dataset. We evaluated the performance of all EfficientNet variants on this imbalanced multiclass classification task using metrics such as Precision, Recall, Accuracy, F1 Score, and Confusion Matrices to determine the effect of transfer learning with fine-tuning. This article presents the classification scores for each class as Confusion Matrices for all eight models. Our best model, the EfficientNet B4, achieved an F1 Score of 87 percent and a Top-1 Accuracy of 87.91 percent. We evaluated EfficientNet classifiers using metrics that take the high-class imbalance into account. Our findings indicate that increased model complexity does not always imply improved classification performance. The best performance arose with intermediate complexity models, such as EfficientNet B4 and B5. The high classification scores resulted from many factors such as resolution scaling, data enhancement, noise removal, successful transfer learning of ImageNet weights, and fine-tuning [70], [71], [72]. Another discovery was that certain classes of skin cancer worked better at generalization than others using Confusion Matrices.}

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have compared the performance of
               artificial intelligence (AI)-based models for automated skin
               cancer classification to human experts, thus setting the
               cornerstone for a successful translation of AI-based tools into
               clinicopathological practice. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the
               study was to systematically analyse the current state of
               research on reader studies involving melanoma and to assess
               their potential clinical relevance by evaluating three main
               aspects: test set characteristics (holdout/out-of-distribution
               data set, composition), test setting (experimental/clinical,
               inclusion of metadata) and representativeness of participating
               clinicians. METHODS: PubMed, Medline and ScienceDirect were
               screened for peer-reviewed studies published between 2017 and
               2021 and dealing with AI-based skin cancer classification
               involving melanoma. The search terms skin cancer classification,
               deep learning, convolutional neural network (CNN), melanoma
               (detection), digital biomarkers, histopathology and whole slide
               imaging were combined. Based on the search results, only studies
               that considered direct comparison of AI results with clinicians
               and had a diagnostic classification as their main objective were
               included. RESULTS: A total of 19 reader studies fulfilled the
               inclusion criteria. Of these, 11 CNN-based approaches addressed
               the classification of dermoscopic images; 6 concentrated on the
               classification of clinical images, whereas 2 dermatopathological
               studies utilised digitised histopathological whole slide images.
               CONCLUSIONS: All 19 included studies demonstrated superior or at
               least equivalent performance of CNN-based classifiers compared
               with clinicians. However, almost all studies were conducted in
               highly artificial settings based exclusively on single images of
               the suspicious lesions. Moreover, test sets mainly consisted of
               holdout images and did not represent the full range of patient
               populations and melanoma subtypes encountered in clinical

              backpropagation by using multiple building blocks, such as
              convolution layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
              This review article offers a perspective on the basic concepts of
              CNN and its application to various radiological tasks, and
              discusses its challenges and future directions in the field of
              radiology. Two challenges in applying CNN to radiological tasks,
              small dataset and overfitting, will also be covered in this
              article, as well as techniques to minimize them. Being familiar
              with the concepts and advantages, as well as limitations, of CNN
              is essential to leverage its potential in diagnostic radiology,
              with the goal of augmenting the performance of radiologists and
              improving patient care. KEY POINTS: • Convolutional neural
              network is a class of deep learning methods which has become
              dominant in various computer vision tasks and is attracting
              interest across a variety of domains, including radiology. •
              Convolutional neural network is composed of multiple building
              blocks, such as convolution layers, pooling layers, and fully
              connected layers, and is designed to automatically and adaptively
              learn spatial hierarchies of features through a backpropagation
              algorithm. • Familiarity with the concepts and advantages, as
              well as limitations, of convolutional neural network is essential
              to leverage its potential to improve radiologist performance and,
              eventually, patient care.",

               convolutional neural networks",

  abstract  = "Importance: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve
               expert-level accuracy in the diagnosis of pigmented melanocytic
               lesions. However, the most common types of skin cancer are
               nonpigmented and nonmelanocytic, and are more difficult to
               diagnose. Objective: To compare the accuracy of a CNN-based
               classifier with that of physicians with different levels of
               experience. Design, Setting, and Participants: A CNN-based
               classification model was trained on 7895 dermoscopic and 5829
               close-up images of lesions excised at a primary skin cancer
               clinic between January 1, 2008, and July 13, 2017, for a
               combined evaluation of both imaging methods. The combined CNN
               (cCNN) was tested on a set of 2072 unknown cases and compared
               with results from 95 human raters who were medical personnel,
               including 62 board-certified dermatologists, with different
               experience in dermoscopy. Main Outcomes and Measures: The
               proportions of correct specific diagnoses and the accuracy to
               differentiate between benign and malignant lesions measured as
               an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve served
               as main outcome measures. Results: Among 95 human raters (51.6\%
               female; mean age, 43.4 years; 95\% CI, 41.0-45.7 years), the
               participants were divided into 3 groups (according to years of
               experience with dermoscopy): beginner raters (10 years). The
               area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the
               trained cCNN was higher than human ratings (0.742; 95\% CI,
               0.729-0.755 vs 0.695; 95\% CI, 0.676-0.713; P < .001). The
               specificity was fixed at the mean level of human raters
               (51.3\%), and therefore the sensitivity of the cCNN (80.5\%;
               95\% CI, 79.0\%-82.1\%) was higher than that of human raters
               (77.6\%; 95\% CI, 74.7\%-80.5\%). The cCNN achieved a higher
               percentage of correct specific diagnoses compared with human
               raters (37.6\%; 95\% CI, 36.6\%-38.4\% vs 33.5\%; 95\% CI,
               31.5\%-35.6\%; P = .001) but not compared with experts (37.3\%;
               95\% CI, 35.7\%-38.8\% vs 40.0\%; 95\% CI, 37.0\%-43.0\%; P =
               .18). Conclusions and Relevance: Neural networks are able to
               classify dermoscopic and close-up images of nonpigmented lesions
               as accurately as human experts in an experimental setting.",

               tissue, which can cause damage to the surrounding tissue,
               disability, and even death. In Indonesia, skin cancer is the
               third leading for most cancer cases after cervical and breast
               cancer. The accuracy of diagnosis and the early proper treatment
               can minimize and control the harmful effects of skin cancer. Due
               to the similar shape of the lesion between skin cancer and
               benign tumor lesions, physicians consuming much more time in
               diagnosing these lesions. The system was developed in this study
               could identify skin cancer and benign tumor lesions
               automatically using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The
               proposed model consists of three hidden layers with an output
               channel of 16,32, and 64 for each layer respectively. The
               proposed model uses several optimizers such as SGD, RMSprop,
               Adam, and Nadam with a learning rate of 0.001. Adam optimizer
               provides the best performance with an accuracy value of 99\% in
               identifying the skin lesions from the ISIC dataset into 4
               classes, namely dermatofibroma, nevus pigmentosus, squamous cell

  abstract  = "Melanoma is one of the four major types of skin cancers caused
               by malignant growth in the melanocyte cells. It is the rarest
               one, accounting to only 1\% of all skin cancer cases. However,
               it is the deadliest among all the skin cancer types. Owing to
               its rarity, efficient diagnosis of the disease becomes rather
               difficult. Here, a deep depthwise separable residual
               convolutional algorithm is introduced to perform binary melanoma
               classification on a dermoscopic skin lesion image dataset. Prior
               to training the model with the dataset noise removal from the
               images using non-local means filter is performed followed by
               enhancement using contrast-limited adaptive histogram
               equilisation over discrete wavelet transform algorithm. Images
               are fed to the model as multi-channel image matrices with
               channels chosen across multiple color spaces based on their
               ability to optimize the performance of the model. Proper lesion
               detection and classification ability of the model are tested by
               monitoring the gradient weighted class activation maps and
               saliency maps, respectively. Dynamic effectiveness of the model
               is shown through its performance in multiple skin lesion image
               datasets. The proposed model achieved an ACC of 99.50\% on

ABSTRACT = {Lack of education is a major concern in underdeveloped countries because it leads to poor human and economic development. The level of education in public institutions varies across all regions around the globe. Current disparities in access to education worldwide are mostly due to systemic regional differences and the distribution of resources. Previous research focused on evaluating students’ academic performance, but less has been done to measure the performance of educational institutions. Key performance indicators for the evaluation of institutional performance differ from student performance indicators. There is a dire need to evaluate educational institutions’ performance based on their disparities and academic results on a large scale. This study proposes a model to measure institutional performance based on key performance indicators through data mining techniques. Various feature selection methods were used to extract the key performance indicators. Several machine learning models, namely, J48 decision tree, support vector machines, random forest, rotation forest, and artificial neural networks were employed to build an efficient model. The results of the study were based on different factors, i.e., the number of schools in a specific region, teachers, school locations, enrolment, and availability of necessary facilities that contribute to school performance. It was also observed that urban regions performed well compared to rural regions due to the improved availability of educational facilities and resources. The results showed that artificial neural networks outperformed other models and achieved an accuracy of 82.9\% when the relief-F based feature selection method was used. This study will help support efforts in governance for performance monitoring, policy formulation, target-setting, evaluation, and reform to address the issues and challenges in education worldwide.},

  abstract  = "There is persuasive evidence that each of the three main types
               of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell
               carcinoma (SCC) and melanoma, is caused by sun exposure. The
               incidence rate of each is higher in fairer skinned,
               sun-sensitive rather than darker skinned, less sun-sensitive
               people; risk increases with increasing ambient solar radiation;
               the highest densities are on the most sun exposed parts of the
               body and the lowest on the least exposed; and they are
               associated in individuals with total (mainly SCC), occupational
               (mainly SCC) and non-occupational or recreational sun exposure
               (mainly melanoma and BCC) and a history of sunburn and presence
               of benign sun damage in the skin. That UV radiation specifically
               causes these skin cancers depends on indirect inferences from
               the action spectrum of solar radiation for skin cancer from
               studies in animals and the action spectrum for dipyrimidine
               dimers and evidence that presumed causative mutations for skin
               cancer arise most commonly at dipyrimidine sites. Sun protection
               is essential if skin cancer incidence is to be reduced. The
               epidemiological data suggest that in implementing sun protection
               an increase in intermittency of exposure should be avoided, that
               sun protection will have the greatest impact if achieved as
               early as possible in life and that it will probably have an
               impact later in life, especially in those who had high childhood
               exposure to solar radiation.",

  abstract  = "According to statistics of the American Cancer Society, in 2015,
               there are about 91,270 American adults diagnosed with melanoma
               of the skin. For the European Union, there are over 90,000 new
               cases of melanoma annually. Although melanoma only accounts for
               about 1\% of all skin cancers, it causes most of the skin cancer
               deaths. Melanoma is considered one of the fastest-growing forms
               of skin cancer, and hence the early detection is crucial, as
               early detection is helpful and can provide strong
               recommendations for specific and suitable treatment regimens. In
               this work, we propose a method to detect melanoma skin cancer
               with automatic image processing techniques. Our method includes
               three stages: pre-process images of skin lesions by adaptive
               principal curvature, segment skin lesions by the colour
               normalisation and extract features by the ABCD rule. We provide
               experimental results of the proposed method on the publicly
               available International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) skin
               lesions dataset. The acquired results on melanoma skin cancer
               detection indicates that the proposed method has high accuracy,
               and overall, a good performance: for the segmentation stage, the
               accuracy, Dice, Jaccard scores are 96.6\%, 93.9\% and 88.7\%,
               respectively; and for the melanoma detection stage, the accuracy
               is up to 100\% for a selected subset of the ISIC dataset.",

  abstract  = "With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), applications have
               become smarter and connected devices give rise to their
               exploitation in all aspects of a modern city. As the volume of
               the collected data increases, Machine Learning (ML) techniques
               are applied to further enhance the intelligence and the
               capabilities of an application. The field of smart
               transportation has attracted many researchers and it has been
               approached with both ML and IoT techniques. In this review,
               smart transportation is considered to be an umbrella term that
               covers route optimization, parking, street lights, accident
               prevention/detection, road anomalies, and infrastructure
               applications. The purpose of this paper is to make a
               self-contained review of ML techniques and IoT applications in
               Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and obtain a clear view
               of the trends in the aforementioned fields and spot possible
               coverage needs. From the reviewed articles it becomes profound
               that there is a possible lack of ML coverage for the Smart
               Lighting Systems and Smart Parking applications. Additionally,
               route optimization, parking, and accident/detection tend to be
               the most popular ITS applications among researchers.",
